\item {\bf Deterministic Extractors on Bit-Fixing Sources}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We can think of generating $X_0$ by $n-t$ independent fair coin flips, so each of its strings occurs with equal probability $2^{t-n}$ and $\Hmin (X_0) = -\log{2^{t-n}}=n-t$.

\item The number of strings with an even number of $0$s is equal to the number of strings with an odd number of $0$s, so each of these is equal to $2^{n-1}$. Thus the min-entropy of $X_1$ is $-\log \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}=(n-1)$.

\item As before, think of generating $X_2$ through a series of independent fair coin flips: it is fully determined by $\frac {n}{2}$ of them and so $\Hmin(X_2)=\frac{n}{2}$.

\item Let us look at all the proposed answers consecutively. We're interested in finding which ones are not constant.
\begin{itemize}
\item $f_1(X_1)$ --- true. The string $X_1$ can be seen as $n-1$ random bits followed by a bit that is fully determined by the previous $n-1$ bits. Since there are $n-1$ random bits, performing \(x_ L\cdot x_ R \) will generate a random bit. Notice that this is not uniformly random; for example, if $n=4$, then an output of $0$ is $3$ times more likely than an output of $1$.
\item $f_1(X_2)$ --- true. Since the first \(\frac{n}{2}\) bits of $X_2$ are the same as the second half, we have \(x_ L\cdot x_ R  = XOR(x_L) = XOR(x_R)\) which is a uniformly random bit since the strings \(x_L=x_R\) are random.
\item $f_2(X_0)$ --- true. Since the last \(n-k\) bits of $X_0$ are fully random, the XOR of the entire string will result in a uniformly random bit.
\item $f_2(X_1)$ --- false. Since the number of $0$'s in the string is known the parity of the string (computed by the XOR) is $0$ for $n$ even.
\item $f_2(X_2)$ --- false. Since the first \(\frac{n}{2}\) bits of $X_2$ are the same as the second half, the parity of the bit string is zero.
\end{itemize}

\item The XOR of all of the bits is equal to $b\oplus r$, for $r$ equal to the XOR of the bits learned by Eve and $b$ equal to the XOR of all of the other bits. Regardless of the distribution of $r$, $b\oplus r$ is uniform independent of Eve's knowledge.

\item $t=n-1$. In this case there is at least one bit that Eve did not get access to. Call this bit $b$. From Eve's point of view, $b$ is uniformly distributed and independent of everything else. We only require the existence of one bit that Eve does not get access to.

\item Following the last question, each subsource must have at least $t+1$ bits. They can make at most $\lfloor \frac{n}{t+1}\rfloor$ such subsources.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
