Ground rules: 

{\bf Please
  format your solutions so that each problem begins on a new page, and
  so that your name appears at the top of each page.}

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on
homework problems, but each person must write up the final solutions
individually. You should note on your homework specifically which
problems were a collaborative effort and with whom. You may not search
online for solutions, but if you do use research papers or other
sources in your solutions, you must cite them.

Late homework will not be accepted or graded. Extensions will not be granted, except on the recommendation of a dean. We will grade as many problems as possible, but sometimes one or two problems will not be graded. Your lowest homework grade of the semester will be dropped from your final grade.

{\bf Problems:}

\begin{enumerate}
		

\item {\bf Perfect secrecy.}
Recall that an encryption scheme $ (\skcgen, \skcenc, \skcdec)$ is called \emph{perfectly secure} if for any messages $m_0,m_1$ and any ciphertext $c$, 
\[ \Pr_{k\gets \skcgen}\big( \skcenc_k(m_0)=c \big)\,=\, \Pr_{k\gets \skcgen}\big( \skcenc_k(m_1)=c \big)\;.\]
  Prove or disprove (giving the
  simplest counterexample you can find) the following statements about
  perfect secrecy for secret-key encryption. 
  \begin{enumerate}
\item Perfect secrecy is equivalent to the following
    definition:
  for any $m_{0}, m_{1} \in \msgspace$, and any function
    $\Adv : \ctspace \to \bit$,
    \[ \Pr_{k \gets \skcgen,\; b \gets_U \bit}[\Adv(\skcenc_{k}(m_{b}))
    = b] = \frac{1}{2}. \]
    \item There is a perfectly secret encryption scheme for
    which the ciphertext always reveals 99\% of the bits of the key
    $k$ to the adversary.
\item There is an encryption scheme that is not perfectly secret, yet
    the adversary cannot guess the key with probability greater than $1/|\calK|$.
\item In a perfectly secret encryption scheme, the
    ciphertext is uniformly random.  That is, for every $m \in
    \msgspace$, the probability $\Pr_{k \gets \skcgen}(\skcenc_{k}(m)
    = {c})$ is the same for every ciphertext ${c} \in
    \ctspace$.
\item Perfect secrecy is equivalent to the following
    definition, which says that the ciphertext and message are
    independent (as random variables).  Formally, for any probability
    distribution $\calD$ over the message space $\msgspace$ and any
    $\bar{m} \in \msgspace$ and $\bar{c} \in \ctspace$,
    \[ \Pr_{m \gets \calD,\; k \gets \skcgen}\big( m = \bar{m} \wedge
    \skcenc_{k}(m) = \bar{c}\big) \,=\, \Pr_{m \gets \calD}(m = \bar{m})\cdot
    \Pr_{m \gets \calD,\; k \gets \skcgen}\big(\skcenc_{k}(m) =
    \bar{c}\big)\;. \]
