Ground rules: 

{\bf Please
  format your solutions so that each problem begins on a new page, and
  so that your name appears at the top of each page.}

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on
homework problems, but each person must write up the final solutions
individually. You should note on your homework specifically which
problems were a collaborative effort and with whom. You may not search
online for solutions, but if you do use research papers or other
sources in your solutions, you must cite them.

Late homework will not be accepted or graded. Extensions will not be granted, except on the recommendation of a dean. We will grade as many problems as possible, but sometimes one or two problems will not be graded. Your lowest homework grade of the semester will be dropped from your final grade.

{\bf Problems:}
\begin{enumerate}

\item (4 points) {\bf The EPR pair.}
Recall the definition of the EPR pair,
\[ \ket{\mathrm{EPR}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big( \ket{0} \otimes \ket{0} + \ket{1}\otimes \ket{1}\big)\;.\]
Prove rigorously that there does not exist two single-qubit states $\ket{\psi}$ and $\ket{\phi}$ such that $\ket{\mathrm{EPR}} = \ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\phi}$. \emph{[Hint: Reason by contradiction. Expand everything in the standard basis.]}


\item {\bf Robustness of GHZ and W States}\label{ex:robust-GHZ}\\
In this problem we explore two classes of $N$-qubit states that are especially useful for cryptography and communication, but behave very differently under tracing out a single qubit. Let's first define them for $N=3$:
\begin{align*}
& \text{GHZ state:} \quad \ket{GHZ_3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{000}+\ket{111}) \\
& \text{W state:} \quad \ket{W_3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} (\ket{100}+\ket{010}+\ket{001})
\end{align*}
Note that both states are symmetric under permutation of the three qubits, so without loss of generality we may trace out the last one, $\Tr_3$. Also, we have analogously $\ket{GHZ_2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{00}+\ket{11})$ and $\ket{W_2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{10}+\ket{01})$.

In the following we consider the \textit{overlap} between $N$-qubit GHZ and W states with one qubit discarded (i.e. traced out) and their $(N-1)$-qubit counterparts. The overlap of density matrices $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is defined as $\Tr \rho\sigma$, a measure of ''closeness'' that generalizes the expression $|\braket{\phi}{\psi}|^2$ for pure states.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the overlap between $\ketbra{GHZ_2}{GHZ_2}$ and $\Tr_3\ketbra{GHZ_3}{GHZ_3}$.
\item Calculate the overlap between  $\ketbra{W_2}{W_2}$ and $\Tr_3\ketbra{W_3}{W_3})$.
\end{enumerate}
Now we generalize to the $N$-qubit case. As you might expect, $\ket{GHZ_N}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0}^{\otimes N}+\ket{1}^{\otimes N})$ and $\ket{W_N}$ is an equal superposition of all $N$-bit strings with exactly one 1 and $N-1$ 0's.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[3.] What is the overlap $\Tr(\ketbra{GHZ_{N-1}}{GHZ_{N-1}} \Tr_N\ketbra{GHZ_N}{GHZ_N})$ in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$?
\item[4.] What is the overlap $\Tr(\ketbra{W_{N-1}}{W_{N-1}} \Tr_N\ketbra{W_N}{W_N})$ in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$?
\end{enumerate}
The interpretation of these results is that $W$ states are more ``robust'' against loss of a single qubit than GHZ states.


\item {\bf Robustness of GHZ and W States, Part 2}\\
We return to the multi-qubit GHZ and W states introduced in the previous exercise. 
In class we learned to distinguish product states from (pure) entangled states by calculating the Schmidt rank of $\ket{\Psi}_{AB}$, i.e. the rank of the reduced state $\rho_A=\Tr_B \ketbra{\Psi}{\Psi}$. In particular $\rho$ is pure if and only if $\ket{\Psi}$ has Schmidt rank 1. In the following, we denote by $\Tr_N$ the operation of tracing out only the last of $N$ qubits.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the ranks $r_{GHZ}$ of $\Tr_N \ketbra{GHZ_N}{GHZ_N}$ and $r_W$ of $\Tr_N \ketbra{W_N}{W_N}$, respectively? (Note that these are the Schmidt ranks of $\ket{GHZ_N}$ and $\ket{W_N}$ if we partition each of them between the first $N-1$ qubits and the last qubit.)
%\solopen{By direct calculation we have $$\Tr_N \proj{GHZ_N} = \frac{1}{2}\proj{0}^{\otimes {N-1}}+\frac{1}{2}\proj{1}^{\otimes {N-1}}$$ and $$\Tr_ N \proj{W_N} = \frac{N-1}{N}\proj{W_{N-1}}+\frac{1}{N}\proj{0}^{\otimes {N-1}}.$$ Both of which are diagonal (in some basis) and have rank 2. Note that this is also the \emph{highest} rank one can get when tracing out a single qubit, as $\rho_A=\rho_B$.}
%
\end{enumerate}
 Let us now introduce a more discriminating (in fact, continuous) measure of the entanglement of a state $\ket{\Psi}_{AB}$: namely, the \textit{purity} of the reduced state $\rho_A$ given by $\Tr \rho_A^2 $. First let's see how this works in practice with the extreme cases in $d$ dimensions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.] What are the purities $\Tr \left(\rho^2\right)$ for $\rho=\ketbra{0}{0}$ and the ''maximally mixed'' state $\rho=\frac{1}{d} \id_d$, respectively?
%\solopen{For $\rho =\proj{0}$ we have $\rho^2=\rho$ and thus $\Tr\left(\rho^2\right)=1$. On the other hand, for $\rho =\frac{1}{d} \id_d$ we have $\rho^2=\frac{1}{d^2} \id_ d$ from which it follows that $\Tr \left(\rho^2\right)=\frac{1}{d}$}
% \begin{enumerate}[a)]
% 	\item 1 and 0
% 	\item 1 and $\frac{1}{d}$
% 	\item 1 and $\frac{1}{d^2}$
% 	\item $\frac{1}{d}$ and $\frac{1}{d^2}$
% \end{enumerate}
%
\item[3.] Is the purity of $\rho_A$ higher or lower for more entangled states $\ket{\Psi}_{AB}$? Can you explain this in terms of the definition $\Tr \left(\rho_A^2\right) $?
%\solopen{The extremes (pure and maximally mixed) that you considered in Problem 2.2 certainly suggest this. Informally, the more entangled $A$ and $B$ are, the more classical uncertainty you have-the more information you lose-in the state $\rho _ A$ of $A$ alone after tracing out $B$. This expresses itself as a lower purity as defined above.}
\end{enumerate}
Now consider again the behavior of the $N$-qubit GHZ and W states with one qubit discarded (i.e. traced out):
\begin{enumerate}
\item[4.] What is the purity of $\Tr_N \ketbra{GHZ_N}{GHZ_N}$ in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$?
%\solopen{Again we have by direct calculation $$\rho = \Tr_ N \proj{GHZ_N} = \frac{1}{2}\proj{0}^{\otimes {N-1}}+\frac{1}{2}\proj{1}^{\otimes {N-1}}$$ from which it follows that $$\rho^2 = \frac{1}{4}\proj{0}^{\otimes {N-1}}+\frac{1}{4}\proj{1}^{\otimes {N-1}}$$ and $\Tr \left(\rho^2\right)=\frac{1}{2}$ for all $N$.}
% \begin{enumerate}[a)]
% 	\item 0
% 	\item $1/N$
% 	\item 1/2
% 	\item 1
% \end{enumerate}
%
\item[5.] What is the purity of $\Tr_N \ketbra{W_N}{W_N}$ in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$?
%\solopen{We have again by direct calculation
%$$\rho = \Tr_N \proj{W_N} = \frac{N-1}{N}\proj{W_{N-1}}+\frac{1}{N}\proj{0}^{\otimes {N-1}}$$ from which it follows that $$\rho ^2 = \frac{(N-1)^2}{N^2}\proj{W_{N-1}}+\frac{1}{N^2}\proj{0}^{\otimes {N-1}}$$ and $\Tr \rho ^2 = \frac{N^2-2N+2}{N^2} \rightarrow 1$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$.}
% \begin{enumerate}[a)]
% 	\item 0
% 	\item $1/N$
% 	\item 1/2
% 	\item 1
% \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Discuss the implications for the ``robustness'' of multipartite entanglement under loss of one qubit in GHZ versus W states. What can we say about losses of more than one qubit?
