\begin{enumerate}
		
\item \textbf{Superdense Coding.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Here one has to be careful about the task. Clearly you are being asked to evaluate a guessing probability. On what state? If we label Alice's two bits as $x,\theta\in\{0,1\}$ then we can write the qubit that encodes them as $\ket{x}_\theta$. The joint state of Alice's bits and the encoded qubit is a cq state $\rho_{X\Theta E} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{x,\theta} \proj{x}\otimes\proj{\theta} \otimes \proj{x}_\theta$. We know that $P_{guess}(X\Theta|E)=2^{-H_{min}(X\Theta|E)}$. To evaluate this last term, we note that by the chain rule $H_{min}(X\Theta|E)\geq H_{min}(X\Theta)-\log|E|$. The first term is the min-entropy of two uniformly random bits, so it equals $2$; and the second term is the size of $E$ in qubits, which is $1$. Therefore, we have established $P_{guess}(X\Theta|E)\leq \frac{1}{2}$. To show that there is equality we design a guessing strategy: Eve measures $E$ in the standard basis, obtains an outcome $y\in\{0,1\}$ and returns $(y,0)$ as her two bits. This is correct with probability $1$ in case the basis was indeed the standard basis, i.e.\ $\theta=0$, and it is correct with probability $0$ in case $\theta=1$. Overall, the success probability is $\frac{1}{2}$.  
 \end{enumerate}
The other questions were solved well and we do not detail the solution. 


\item  \textbf{Secret sharing among three people.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We directly calculate one matrix and use the symmetry among $A,B,C$ to extrapolate the others. $$\begin{aligned}\rho_{A} & = \text{Tr}_{BC}(\ketbra{\Psi}\Psi) \\  & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A\otimes\text{tr}(\ketbra{0}0_B)\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{0}0_C) + (-1)^{2b} \ketbra{1}1_A\otimes\text{tr}(\ketbra{1}1_B)\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{1}1_C)) \\ & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A + \ketbra{1}1_A) \\ & = \frac{\mathbb{I}}2\end{aligned}$$ We similarly have $\rho_B =\frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_B + \ketbra{1}1_B) = \frac{\mathbb{I}}2$ and $\rho_C = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_C + \ketbra{1}1_C) = \frac{\mathbb{I}}2$. This state is independent of $b$ and so any measurement on a single system will lead to an outcome distribution that is independent of $b$: the secret cannot be retrieved by one party only. \\ 

\item Again calculate one matrix and use the symmetry among $A,B,C$ to extrapolate the others. $$\begin{aligned}\rho_{AB} & = \text{Tr}_{C}(\ketbra{\Psi}\Psi) \\  & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A\otimes\ketbra{0}0_B\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{0}0_C) + (-1)^{2b} \ketbra{1}1_A\otimes\ketbra{1}1_B\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{1}1_C)) \\ & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A\otimes \ketbra{0}0_B + \ketbra{1}1_A\otimes \ketbra{1}1_B) \\ & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{00}{00}_{AB} + \ketbra{11}{11}_{AB})\end{aligned}$$ and similarly $\rho_{BC} = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{00}{00}_{BC} + \ketbra{11}{11}_{BC})$ and $\rho_{AC} = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{00}{00}_{AC} + \ketbra{11}{11}_{AC})$.  These densities are independent of $b$, so any measurement made by any pair will not give information about $b$.

\item Have Alice, Bob, and Charlie apply the Hadamard operation on their qubit to get the new state $$\ket{\Psi_0} = \frac{1}4((\ket{0}+\ket{1})^3 + (\ket{0}-\ket{1})^3) = \frac{1}4((\ket{000}+\ket{011}+\ket{110}+\ket{101})$$ if $b=0$ and the new state $$ \ket{\Psi_1} = \frac{1}4((\ket{0}+\ket{1})^3 - (\ket{0} - \ket{1})^3) = \frac{1}4 (\ket{001}+\ket{010}+\ket{100}+\ket{111})$$ if $b=1$. Next, we have Alice, Bob, and Charlie measure their qubits. Note by inspection, the tensor product of all three observations must either be in the set $$S_0 = \{\ket{0}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{0}_C, \ket{0}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{1}_C,  \ket{1}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{0}_C,\ket{1}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{1}_C\}$$ if $b=0$, and must be in the set $$S_1 = \{\ket{0}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{1}_C, \ket{0}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{0}_C,  \ket{1}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{0}_C,\ket{1}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{1}_C\}$$ if $b=1$. \\ 

 Hence we can have Alice and Bob send their measurement to Charlie, and Charlie will see whether their collective measurements are in $S_0$ or $S_1$ to recover $b$.
\end{enumerate} 

\item {\bf Quantum money security variant.}
The scheme is \emph{not} secure under the new security definition. Consider the following adversary, which runs in exponential time. The adversary ignores the quantum bill sent by the challenger. Instead, for every possible pair $x,\theta\in \{0,1\}^n$ the adversary does the following: prepare the $n$-qubit state $\ket{x}_\theta$ and send it for verification. If verification fails, proceed to the next pair $x,\theta$. If it succeeds, then prepare two fresh copies of $\ket{x}_\theta$ (which is possible since $x,\theta$ are known) and submit them as response to the challenger. This adversary succeeds with probability $1$, after at most $2^n\times 2^n$ attempts at verification. 


\item {\bf Inner product extractor.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The family is not $2$-universal (in fact, it is not even $1$-universal) because for the case where $x=0^n$, $x'\neq x$, $z=1$ and $z'$ arbitrary we calculate $\Pr_y[f_y(x)=z \wedge f_y(x')=z')=0$ (because $f_y(0^n)=0$ for all $y$), and not $\frac{1}{4}$ as would be required for a $2$-universal family (note that here the parameter $m=1$).
\begin{enumerate}
\item This question could be approached in different ways. One possibility is to use the characterization of the trace norm as $\|\sigma_{0,y}-\sigma_{1,y}\|_{tr}=\sup_{0\leq M \leq \Id} \Tr(M(\sigma_{0,y}-\sigma_{1,y}))$. Because $0\leq M\leq \Id$ the right-hand side is always at most $1$. For there to be equality, for the optimal $M$ we must have $\Tr(M\sigma_{0,y})=1$ and $\Tr(M\sigma_{0,y})=0$. Now we can see that if we replace $M$ by the projection $P$ on its support (i.e.\ round the singular values to $1$, unless they are $0$) the condition $\Tr(P\sigma_{0,y})=0$ still holds but $\Tr(P\sigma_{1,y})\geq \Tr(M\sigma_{1,y})=1$. Since of course $\Tr(P\sigma_{1,y})\leq \Tr(\sigma_{1,y})=1$, we are done. 
\item Let $P_y$ be the projection obtained in the previous question. We verify that the map 
\[ U:\ket{\psi}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{0}_A \mapsto P_y\ket{\psi}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{0}_A +(\Id-P_y)\ket{\psi}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{1}_A \;,\]
defined as such on every state $\ket{\psi}_E$ and $\ket{y}$, can be extended into a valid unitary. This is verified by checking that inner products are preserved, i.e. for any $\ket{\psi}_E$, $\ket{\psi'}_E$ and $y,y'$, 
\begin{align*}
\big(P_y\ket{\psi}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{0}_A &+(\Id-P_y)\ket{\psi}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{1}_A\big)^\dagger\cdot\big(P_{y'}\ket{\psi'}_E\ket{y'}_Y\ket{0}_A \\
&\qquad\qquad+(\Id-P_{y'})\ket{\psi'}_E\ket{y'}_Y\ket{1}_A\big)\\
&= \delta_{yy'} \bra{\psi}_E P_y \ket{\psi'}_E + \bra{\psi}_E (\Id-P_y) \ket{\psi'}_E \\
&= \delta_{yy'} \langle \psi \ket{\psi'}_E\;,
\end{align*}
where for the last two lines we used that $P_y$ is an orthogonal projection (and in particular $P_y(\Id-P_y)=0$). 
\item This is a direct calculation and we find 
\[U'\ket{\psi_x}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{0}_A\ket{-}_B=(-1)^{x\cdot y}\ket{\psi_x}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{0}_A\ket{-}_B\;.\]
\item Given $\ket{\psi_x}$, $V$ first applies some Hadamards on the $Y$ register to create $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_y \ket{y}$. It also applies an $X$ followed by a Hadamard on $B$ to create a $\ket{-}$. It then applies $U'$ from the previous question, and undoes all the Hadamards and the $X$. This amounts to performing a QFT and the result is exactly the one desired. 
\item We see that assumption (2) implies that it is possible to exactly recover $X$ from $E$, and thus this is only possible in case $H_{min}(X|E)=0$.
