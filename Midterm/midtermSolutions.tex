Ground rules: 

{\bf Please
  format your solutions so that each problem begins on a new page, and
  so that your name appears at the top of each page.}

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on
homework problems, but each person must write up the final solutions
individually. You should note on your homework specifically which
problems were a collaborative effort and with whom. You may not search
online for solutions, but if you do use research papers or other
sources in your solutions, you must cite them.

Late homework will not be accepted or graded. Extensions will not be granted, except on the recommendation of a dean. We will grade as many problems as possible, but sometimes one or two problems will not be graded. Your lowest homework grade of the semester will be dropped from your final grade.

{\bf Problems:}

\begin{enumerate}
		
\item {\bf An optimal attack}\label{ex:opt-wiesner}
 






\item  \textbf{Secret sharing among three people.}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We directly calculate one matrix and use the symmetry among $A,B,C$ to extrapolate the others. $$\begin{aligned}\rho_{A} & = \text{Tr}_{BC}(\ketbra{\Psi}\Psi) \\  & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A\otimes\text{tr}(\ketbra{0}0_B)\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{0}0_C) + (-1)^{2b} \ketbra{1}1_A\otimes\text{tr}(\ketbra{1}1_B)\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{1}1_C)) \\ & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A + \ketbra{1}1_A) \\ & = \frac{\mathbb{I}}2\end{aligned}$$ We similarly have $\rho_B =\frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_B + \ketbra{1}1_B) = \frac{\mathbb{I}}2$ and $\rho_C = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_C + \ketbra{1}1_C) = \frac{\mathbb{I}}2$. Notice that this state is independent of $b$ and so any measurement these people take alone will be independent of $b$, and the secret cannot be retrieved on their own. \\ 

\item Again calculate one matrix and use the symmetry among $A,B,C$ to extrapolate the others. $$\begin{aligned}\rho_{AB} & = \text{Tr}_{C}(\ketbra{\Psi}\Psi) \\  & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A\otimes\ketbra{0}0_B\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{0}0_C) + (-1)^{2b} \ketbra{1}1_A\otimes\ketbra{1}1_B\otimes \text{tr}(\ketbra{1}1_C)) \\ & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{0}0_A\otimes \ketbra{0}0_B + \ketbra{1}1_A\otimes \ketbra{1}1_B) \\ & = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{00}{00}_{AB} + \ketbra{11}{11}_{AB})\end{aligned}$$ and similarly $\rho_{BC} = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{00}{00}_{BC} + \ketbra{11}{11}_{BC})$ and $\rho_{AC} = \frac{1}2(\ketbra{00}{00}_{AC} + \ketbra{11}{11}_{AC})$. Again, we see that these densities are independent of $B$, so any measurement made by any pair of people will not give information about $b$.

\item Have Alice, Bob, and Charlie apply the Hadamard operation on their qubit to get the new state $$\ket{\Psi_0} = \frac{1}4((\ket{0}+\ket{1})^3 + (\ket{0}-\ket{1})^3) = \frac{1}4((\ket{000}+\ket{011}+\ket{110}+\ket{101})$$ if $b=0$ and the new state $$ \ket{\Psi_1} = \frac{1}4((\ket{0}+\ket{1})^3 - (\ket{0} - \ket{1})^3) = \frac{1}4 (\ket{001}+\ket{010}+\ket{100}+\ket{111})$$ if $b=1$. Next, we have Alice, Bob, and Charlie measure their qubits. Note by inspection, the tensor product of all three observations must either be in the set $$S_0 = \{\ket{0}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{0}_C, \ket{0}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{1}_C,  \ket{1}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{0}_C,\ket{1}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{1}_C\}$$ if $b=0$, and must be in the set $$S_1 = \{\ket{0}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{1}_C, \ket{0}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{0}_C,  \ket{1}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{0}_C,\ket{1}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{1}_C\}$$ if $b=1$. \\ 

 Hence we can have Alice and Bob send their measurement to Charlie, and Charlie will see whether their collective measurements are in $S_0$ or $S_1$ to recover $b$.
