{\bf Please
  format your solutions so that each problem begins on a new page, and
  so that your name appears at the top of each page.}

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on
homework problems, but each person must write up the final solutions
individually. You should note on your homework specifically which
problems were a collaborative effort and with whom. You may not search
online for solutions, but if you do use research papers or other
sources in your solutions, you must cite them.

Late homework will not be accepted or graded. Extensions will not be granted, except on the recommendation of a dean. We will grade as many problems as possible, but sometimes one or two problems will not be graded. Your lowest homework grade of the semester will be dropped from your final grade.

{\bf Problems:}

\begin{enumerate}
		



\item (6 points) \textbf{Superdense Coding.}\\
In Homework 1, you were introduced to the idea of "quantum teleportation". By sending just two bits of classical information, Alice was able to "teleport" her single-qubit quantum state to Bob, provided they shared a pair of maximally entangled qubits to begin with. \\
In this problem, Alice instead wants to share two classical bits with Bob, but she only has a quantum channel at her disposal, and she is only allowed to use it once (i.e. send only one single-qubit state). Can she succeed? \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] The first idea she has is to encode her two classical bits into her preparation of one of four states in $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1}, \ket{+}, \ket{-}\}$, and then send this qubit to Bob. \\
Suppose that the a priori distribution of Alice's two classical bits is uniform. What is the maximum probability with which Bob can correctly guess both of Alice's two classical bits?\\
\item[(b)] Suppose that Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled pair of qubits. Alice thinks that it is a good idea to start by performing one of four unitary transformations on the qubit in her possession depending on the value of the two classical bits that she wishes to communicate and send her qubit to Bob. What next? Help Alice (and Bob) devise a scheme that achieves the desired task with certainty.\\
\item[(c)] After all the thought that Alice and Bob put into coming up with a working scheme, they finally decide to employ it.\\
Unfortunately, the tireless eavesdropper Eve has heard of their new scheme, and as soon as Alice and Bob use it, she intercepts the qubit as it's sent from Alice to Bob. Can Eve recover information about the two confidential classical bits that Alice intended to share with Bob?\\
\end{enumerate}


\item (6 points) \textbf{Secret sharing among three people.}\\
In class we saw how to share a classical secret between two people using an entangled state. In this problem we create a scheme that shares a classical secret among three people, Alice, Bob and Charlie. We encode the secret $b\in \{0,1\}$ in a GHZ-like state of the form
\[
\ket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}_A\ket{0}_B\ket{0}_C+ (-1)^b\ket{1}_A\ket{1}_B\ket{1}_C).
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Calculate the single-party reduced density matrices $\rho_A$, $\rho_B$, and $\rho_C$. Verify that no single one of Alice, Bob, and Charlie can recover the secret on their own.
\item[(b)] Calculate the two-party reduced densities $\rho_{AB}$, $\rho_{BC}$, and $\rho_{AC}$. Verify that no pair of Alice, Bob, and Charlie can recover the secret on their own.
\item[(c)] Suppose each of Alice, Bob, and Charlie is limited to the following operations:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Local Hadamard operation on their qubit;
	\item Local measurement of their qubit in the computational basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$;
	\item Sending a (classical) measurement outcome to one of the other two players.
	\end{itemize}
Devise a scheme by which they can together recover the secret $b$. 
\end{enumerate}
%[A scheme of the type considered in part (c) is called an \emph{LOCC protocol}, for ``local operations and classical communication''. You may wish to think if there exists a secret-sharing scheme such that even an LOCC protocol would not allow colluding parties to recover the secret? Intuitively, such a scheme would have the property that the secret is hidden ``deep inside the entanglement'', in the sense that even if everyone decides to collaborate in cheating \emph{but} is restricted to LOCC then they still can't recover the secret. In such a situtation the only way to recover the secret would be to get access to the entire quantum state at once and make a general measurement on all the shares (as opposed to local measurements followed by exchange of classical information).]




\item (8 points) {\bf Inner product extractor.}

Define the inner product extractor $\Ext_\IP:\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ by $\Ext_\IP(x,y)=x\cdot y\mod 2$. Our goal is to show that this is a valid strong seeded extractor. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let 
\[\mathcal{F}=\big\{f_y:x\mapsto x\cdot y \ | \ y\in\{0,1\}^n\big\}\subseteq \big\{ f: \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}\big\}\;.\]
Show that $\mathcal{F}$ is $2$-universal.
\end{enumerate}
Based on the work done in class, we already know that $\Ext_\IP$ is a $(k,\eps)$ extractor for any $k\geq 1+2\log(1/\eps)$. The goal of this exercise is to give a different, more direct proof of this fact. In the following we consider a source of the form
\[\rho_{XE}=\proj{\psi}_{XE}\;, \quad\text{where}\quad \ket{\psi}_{XE}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^n} \ket{x}_X\ket{\psi_x}_E\;.\]
Here, the $\ket{\psi_x}$ are normalized states (but not necessarily orthogonal), so that the marginal on $X$ is uniform: $\rho_X= \frac{1}{2^n}\Id_X$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)] We first rule out perfect adversaries. Namely, suppose that $\ket{\psi}_{XE}$ is such that given any $y\in\{0,1\}^n$, there is a measurement $\{M^y_b\}$ on $E$ that returns $x\cdot y$ with certainty, i.e. $\Tr(M^y_{b} \rho_x)=1$ if $b=x\cdot y$ and $0$ otherwise. 
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Show carefully that there is a unitary $U$ acting on $E$, $Y$, and an additional single-qubit register $A$ such that $U:\ket{\psi_x}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{0}_A \mapsto \ket{\psi_x}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{x\cdot y}_A$ for all $x,y$.
\item Consider an additional register $B$, initialized in $\ket{-}_B$. Compute the effect of  
\[  U':=(U\otimes \Id_B)^\dagger (\Id_{EY}\otimes \mathrm{CNOT}_{A\to B})(U\otimes \Id_{B})\]
 on $\ket{\psi_x}_E\ket{y}_Y\ket{0}_A\ket{-}_B$, where here  $\mathrm{CNOT}_{A\to B}$ applies an $X$ bit flip to $B$ controlled on $A$ being in state $\ket{1}$.
\item Deduce that there is a unitary $V: \ket{\psi_x}_E\ket{0}_Y\ket{0}_A\ket{0}_B\mapsto \ket{x}_E\ket{0}_Y\ket{0}_A\ket{0}_B$ for all $x$ (where we make sure that $E$ is large enough so that we are able to write `$x$' in it). Say how to construct $V$ as a function of $U'$ and any other building blocks you may need. 
\item State an upper bound on $\Hmin(X|E)_\rho$ for this (i.e.\ the assumption in (b)(i)) to be possible. 
\end{enumerate}
\item[(c)] We now analyze the more delicate case where the adversary does not perfectly predict the inner product. Let 
\[ \rho_{ZYE}=\frac{1}{2^{2n}}\sum_{x,y} \proj{x\cdot y}\otimes \proj{y}\otimes\proj{\psi_x}\quad\text{and}\quad\eps = \Big\|\rho_{ZYE} - \frac{\Id_Z}{2} \otimes \frac{\Id_Y}{2^n}  \otimes \rho^E\Big\|_{tr}\;.\]
 \begin{enumerate}
\item For $b\in\{0,1\}$ and $y\in\{0,1\}^n$ let $\sigma_{b,y} = \frac{1}{2^{2n}}\sum_{x:\ c\cdot y=b} \proj{\psi_x}_E$. 
 Show that for every $y$, there is a measurement $\{M^y_b\}_{b\in\{0,1\}}$ on $E$ such that 
\[\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_y \Big(  \frac{1}{2}\Tr(M^y_{0} \sigma_{0,y})+\frac{1}{2}\Tr(M^y_{1} \rho_{1,y})\Big) \geq \delta\;,\]
 for some $\delta$ depending on $\eps$ that you will determine. 
\item Deduce that there is a unitary $U:\ket{\psi_x}\ket{y}\ket{a} \mapsto \ket{\psi'_x}\ket{y}(\alpha_{x,y}\ket{a\oplus x\cdot y}+\beta_{x,y}\ket{a\oplus x\cdot y\oplus 1})$ for all $x,y$ and $a\in\{0,1\}$, and where $2^{-2n}\sum_{x,y} |\alpha_{x,y}|^2 \geq \delta$. Here, $\ket{\psi'_x}$ may be different from $\ket{\psi_x}$ but it is still normalized.
\item Let $\ket{\psi_{ideal}} = (-1)^{x\cdot y}\ket{\psi_x}\ket{y}\ket{0}\ket{-}$ be the ``ideal'' state obtained as in (b)(ii). Compute the \emph{difference} between $\ket{\psi_{ideal}}$ and $U'\ket{\psi_x}\ket{y}\ket{0}\ket{-}$ and bound its norm as a function of $\alpha_{xy}$ and $\beta_{xy}$.
\item Deduce a lower bound on $k$, as a function of $n$ and $\eps$, such that $\Ext_\IP$ is a $(k,\eps)$ strong extractor.
